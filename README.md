# INTO TO DARKNESS
## Passion Project - 2022 - ASP.NET

**This project is created for an imaginary video game which I named "Into the Darkness"**

##### This is my passion project, and it was influenced by video games in general.
##### For this project, there are three sections:
1. **Creatures**
2. **Races**
3. **Dungeons**

##### Logic:
- **Each creature is a member of a race**

- **Many creatures can share the same race**

- **Dungeons can contain a variety of monsters**

- **Creatures can reside in multiple dungeons**

#### Admin Features
**CRUD(create, read, delete, update) functionality is applied to this project to be able to manage all content**
**Adding a creature:**
- Once you are on "Creatures" tab, you can add a new creature simply clicking "New Creature"
- It will ask you for filling up a form which requires "Creature Name - Power(Max 1000) - Race), and click "Add Creature" to add this creature to the system
- You can view this creature in Creatures tab showing creatures available
- if you go through specific creature, you can edit and add image showing creature itself

**Adding a race:**
- Once you are on "Races" tab, you can add a new race simply clicking "New Race"
- It will ask you for filling up a form which requires "Race Name - Offensive(Checkbox))", and click "Create Race" to add this race to the system
- You can view this race in Races tab showing races available

**Adding a dungeon:**
- Once you are on "Dungeons" tab, you can add a new dungeon simply clicking "New Dungeon"
